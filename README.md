# Advanced Mathematics for Engineeris
# Laboratory 1 Part A: Continuous & Discrete Time

The aim of this laboratory is to continue the process of learning the fundamentals of MATLAB such as data entry, plotting, and data handling as well as how to create a continous time singal x(t) and then sample the continuous time signal to produce a discrete time singal x[nT<sub>s</sub>].

This particular exercise will apply <b>Shannon's Sampling Theorem</b> to identify the correct sampling rate. Thr mathematical process used will be periodic sampling. 

This exercise will also include a short laboratory report. This report will be used to construct a logbook for the mathematics module in the academic year of 2021/2022. 

The laboratory report will consist of the following:
  - Relevant theory
  - Key equations
  - Hand calculations
  - Computer code
  - Diagrams, figures, and tables of results
  - Discussion of your workings
