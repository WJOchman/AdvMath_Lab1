<H1>Advanced Mathematics for Engineers</h1>
<h1>Laboratory 1 Part A: Continuous & Discrete Time</h1>

The aim of this laboratory is to continue the process of learning the fundamentals of MATLAB such as data entry, plotting, and data handling as well as how to create a continous time singal x(t) and then sample the continuous time signal to produce a discrete time singal x[nT<sub>s</sub>].

This particular exercise will apply <b>Shannon's Sampling Theorem</b> to identify the correct sampling rate. Thr mathematical process used will be periodic sampling. 

This exercise will also include a short laboratory report. This report will be used to construct a logbook for the mathematics module in the academic year of 2021/2022. 

The laboratory report will consist of the following:
  - Relevant theory
  - Key equations
  - Hand calculations
  - Computer code
  - Diagrams, figures, and tables of results
  - Discussion of your workings 

<h2>Laboratory 1 Part A:</h2>
<h3>Task 1: Construction of Continuous Time Signal</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Go to 'file', 'new' and open a script file. Give the file a sensible name (no white spaces between words) and save it. All your code will be written into this one script file.</li>
    <li>Within the script file, construct a time base that ranges from 0s to 0.666s in increments of 0.001s.</li>
    <li>Next, write the code that will calculate a 3Hz sinewave over the specified time base (help 'sin'); assign the sine wave to a sensible variable name.</li>
  </ol>
  
   
   
 
<h3>Task 2: Plotting of Continuous Time Signal</h3>
<h3>Task 3: Continuous Time to Discrete Conversion</h3>
<h3>Task 4: Displaying Results</h3>
<h3>Task 5: Data Handling</h3>
