<H1>Advanced Mathematics for Engineeris</h1>
<h1>Laboratory 1 Part A: Continuous & Discrete Time</h1>

The aim of this laboratory is to continue the process of learning the fundamentals of MATLAB such as data entry, plotting, and data handling as well as how to create a continous time singal x(t) and then sample the continuous time signal to produce a discrete time singal x[nT<sub>s</sub>].

This particular exercise will apply <b>Shannon's Sampling Theorem</b> to identify the correct sampling rate. Thr mathematical process used will be periodic sampling. 

This exercise will also include a short laboratory report. This report will be used to construct a logbook for the mathematics module in the academic year of 2021/2022. 

The laboratory report will consist of the following:
  - Relevant theory
  - Key equations
  - Hand calculations
  - Computer code
  - Diagrams, figures, and tables of results
  - Discussion of your workings
