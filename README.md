# Advanced Mathematics for Engineeris
# Laboratory 1 PartA: Continuous & Discrete Time

The aim of this laboratory is to continue the process of learning the fundamentals of MATLAB such as data entry, plotting, and data handling as well as how to create a continous time singal x(t) and then sample the continuous time signal to produce a discrete time singal x[nT<sup>s</sup>].
